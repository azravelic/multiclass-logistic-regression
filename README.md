# Multiclass Logistic Regression


# Goal: 
Develop the system for predicting the type of penguin using regularized logistic regression.

# Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/penguin-dataset-the-new-iris

The dataset consists of labeled data representing penguins' key characteristics from Palmer Archipelago, such as species, culmen length [mm], culmen depth [mm], flipper length [mm], body mass [g], island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe), and sex (female, male).


# Assignment
Load the dataset, preprocess it, and divide it into the train (80%), validation (10%), and test set (10%). Train the model using regularized logistic regression. Evaluate the model based on commonly used evaluation metrics for classification and decide further steps according to that evaluation. Visualize the final results.
